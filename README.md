## Setup
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository or [download zip](https://github.com/thedevs-network/kutt/archive/develop.zip).
2. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js` in both server and client folders and fill them properly.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start Neo4j database.
5. Run for development: `npm run dev`.
6. Run for production: `npm run build` then `npm start`.

**Docker:** You can use Docker to run the app. Read [docker-examples](/docker-examples) for more info.

## API
In additional to the website, you can use these APIs to create, delete and get URLs.

### Types

```
URL {
  createdAt {string} ISO timestamp of when the URL was created
  id {string} Unique ID of the URL
  target {string} Where the URL will redirect to
  password {boolean} Whether or not a password is required
  count {number} The amount of visits to this URL
  shortUrl {string} The shortened link (Usually https://kutt.it/id)
}
```

In order to use these APIs you need to generate an API key from settings. Do not ever put this key in the client side of your app or anywhere that is exposed to others.

All API requests and responses are in JSON format.

Include the API key as `X-API-Key` in the header of all below requests. Available API URLs with body parameters:

**Get shortened URLs list:**
```
GET /api/url/geturls
```

Returns:
```
{
  list {Array<URL>} List of URL objects
  countAll {number} Amount of items in the list
}
```

**Submit a link to be shortened**:
```
POST /api/url/submit
```
Body:
  * `target`: Original long URL to be shortened.

Returns: URL object

**Delete a shortened URL** and **Get stats for a shortened URL:**
```
POST /api/url/deleteurl
GET /api/url/stats
```
Body (or query for GET request)
  * `id`: ID of the shortened URL.
  * `domain` (optional):  Required if a custom domain is used for short URL.
